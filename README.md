Welcome to the Drupal Hyderabad Group. This Group is to allow Hyderabadi Drupal Users and Developers to communicate and
organizes activities to promote the interest of Drupal among designers, developers,academia, students, . . . etc. Drupal Hyderabad 
has organized DrupalCamp Hyderabad 2017 in IIITH and monthly meetups in May and June.
Drupal Camp Hyderabad 2017 had 200+ participants from various companies,
organizations and colleges .

We have a great meetup every month second saturday where we get together to connect in person. The target audience is Drupal developers, users, and people who want to learn more about Drupal. 

We start the meetups with a round of very focused lightning talks that discuss real world solutions to existing problems, new work people have done, and Drupal news. Some of these talks are about code, and some are not. We do ask that all presenters talk on a level that everyone - including non-developers - can follow. 

We are taking an initiative to bring all the local communities of Drupal
in India together by organizing national wide virtual events. We aspire to drastically improve the participation in the events 
by reaching out to all the communities and increase Drupal contributions. We are also trying toget more employment opportunities 
in Drupal at a larger scale, we also hope to bring some momentum to the Free and Open Source Movement.
